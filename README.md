### ODU CS 395 Spring 2020 -- Research Methods in Data and Web Science
Instructor: [Michael L. Nelson](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/) <mln@cs.odu.edu> 

Office Hours: Wednesdays 2-4 and by appointment

Time: Wednesdays 4:20pm - 7pm

Place: Dragas, r. 1102

Pre-/Co-requisites: CS 330, CS 300T

### Class Goals

This class is intended for academic juniors (or higher) considering a career in research in data and web science.  Since research is not a solitary activity, class work will occur in groups.  To prepare students for a research career, we will cover a range of topics including:

* Data management and software engineering tools: Git/GitHub, Docker, Travis CI, cloud computing, virtual machines, etc.

* Languages and Environments: Python, R, Unix CLI, LaTeX, Overleaf, REST APIs, etc.

* Participating in the scholarly communication process: reading and summarizing papers, preparing and giving presentations, documenting your own research findings, the spectrum of scholarly communication, etc.

* Preparing proposals: students will read, review, and finally prepare their own actual research proposal(s) to be submitted to places like the National Science Foundation (NSF), Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and others as idenfitied.  

* Reproducibility and Replicability: students will work in teams to identify published data and web science studies that they will [reproduce and/or replicate](https://phys.org/news/2019-05-replicability-science.html). 

### Class Schedule

The exact schedule is still TBD, but the class will feature lectures from the instructor, guest lectures (internal and external), and student-led lectures. 

### Class Deliverables

At the end of the class, each student will have:

* GitHub account + software / data repos resulting from class work
* A professional identity, via a Google Scholar account, Twitter account, LinkedIn account, etc.
* At least one submitted proposal to an external agency
* At least one published technical report at [arXiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org), co-authored with Dr. Nelson and possibly other faculty and students from the [Web Sciences and Digital Libraries Research Group](https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/Main/People)

### Class Grading 

The exact grading criteria are still TBD, but the class will not have conventional: mid-term and final exams, tests, quizzes, etc.  

Instead, the grades will be determined by class participation and the quality of the aforementioned deliverables.
