  studies. Your work in this course and classroom behavior must
  align with the expectations outlined in the Code of Student
  Conduct, which can be found at www.odu.edu/oscai. The following
  behaviors along with classroom disruptions violate this policy,
  corrupt the educational process, and will not be tolerated.

  will be submitted to the Department of Computer Science for further
  review. Note that academic integrity violations can result in a
  permanent notation being placed on the student's transcript or
  even expulsion from the University. Evidence of cheating may
  include a student being unable to satisfactorily answer questions
  asked by the instructor about a submitted solution. Cheating
  includes not only receiving unauthorized assistance, but also
  giving unauthorized assistance.
